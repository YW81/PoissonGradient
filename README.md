# PoissonGradient

# Poisson Blending with adapted gradients

This library is a simple demonstration of using Optimal Transport Mapping Estimation [1]
in a context of seamless copy between images. See [1] for details over the method

## Installation

The Library has been tested on Linux and MacOSX. Among other classical dependencies, it requires the installation of POT, the Python Optimal Transport library (https://github.com/rflamary/POT)

- Numpy (>=1.11)
- Scipy (>=0.17)
- Matplotlib (>=1.5)
- POT (>=1.0)



## Examples

One notebook is provided as example of use:
